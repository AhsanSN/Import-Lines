                Let’s face it; most Pakistan credit cards are not accepted on international brands’ websites, and mostly shipping is also not available for Pakistan. If you are lucky to beat these hurdles, your item will be shipped but the local government customs will impose more challenges such as clearance fees and unnecessary delays that eventually becomes a headache to deal with. Running in circles and eventually paying double the cost of product prices; in shape of bribes & other charges is what customers usually end up with when they try to have their products shipped directly!
